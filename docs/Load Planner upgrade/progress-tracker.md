## Living Context

>
> ### Project State
> The Load Planner is a logistics optimization system inside the Seahorse Inland / dismantle-pro Next.js application. It handles cargo parsing (AI-powered via Claude), truck recommendation (54 trailer types with scoring), multi-truck load planning (2D/3D bin packing), 50-state permit calculation, escort/HOS/securement compliance, and quote generation with PDF sharing.
>
> ### What Has Been Done
> - Full audit of all load planner modules completed (Jan 27, 2026)
> - 45 issues identified across 5 severity phases
> - Detailed implementation plans written for all 45 issues (see phase files)
> - **P1-01 COMPLETED**: Dollar vs cents unit mismatch fixed. All monetary values now standardized to cents across escort-calculator, cost-optimizer, permit-calculator, and load-planner modules.
> - **P1-02 COMPLETED**: Hotshot tractor weight fixed. Added `powerUnitWeight` field to `TruckType` interface and all 62 truck definitions. Hotshot=9k, SPMT=0, heavy haul=20k, standard=17k. All GVW calculations across 7 files now use `truck.powerUnitWeight` instead of hardcoded `LEGAL_LIMITS.TRACTOR_WEIGHT`.
> - **P1-03 COMPLETED**: Fallback placement at (0,0) overlapping cargo fixed. Failed placements now marked with `failed: true` flag instead of silently overlapping. Fixed broken `canFitOnTruck()` and `rebalanceLoads()` merge verification that always passed due to fallback. Warnings generated for failed placements. Visualization shows failed items in red hatched style with "NOT PLACED" label.
> - **P1-04 COMPLETED**: Drive axle weight can no longer go negative. Replaced broken single-beam model (fixed 33% steer ratio, moments computed about inconsistent reference points) with proper 2-beam pin-jointed model. Beam 1 (trailer) solves kingpin + trailer axle reactions. Beam 2 (tractor) uses kingpin reaction to solve steer + drive axle weights via moment balance. Added `steerAxlePosition` to `AxleConfiguration` interface and all 18 default configs. Conservation law now always holds: steer + drive + trailer = totalGross. Added underload/imbalance warnings for negative axle weights, low steer axle (<10k lbs), and any axle below 5% of GVW. Self-propelled (SPMT) handled as special case (all weight on trailer axles).
> - **P1-05 COMPLETED**: Tridem axle limit formula corrected. Per-axle weight increment beyond tridem changed from 8,000 lbs to 5,500 lbs per axle (conservative estimate for typical 4-5 ft axle spacing per 23 CFR 658.17). Added named constant `PER_ADDITIONAL_AXLE: 5500` to `AXLE_LIMITS`. Formula in `scoreWeightDistribution()` now uses `AXLE_LIMITS.PER_ADDITIONAL_AXLE` instead of hardcoded magic number.
> - **P1-06 COMPLETED**: WLL now adjusted for tie-down angle per DOT 49 CFR 393.106. Added `effectiveWLL` field to `TieDownPoint` interface and `calculateEffectiveWLL(wll, angle)` helper using `wll × cos(angle)`. All compliance checks now use effective (angle-adjusted) WLL instead of rated WLL. Added `totalRatedWLL` field to `SecurementPlan` for transparency. Notes generated when angle reduces effectiveness by >15%. Validation messages report both rated and effective WLL when deficit exists. Steep angle warnings (>60°) now show actual effectiveness percentage.
> - **P1-07 COMPLETED**: HOS 70-hour/8-day cycle now fully enforced. Previously, `validateTripHOS()` only compared drive time to cycle remaining — it did not account for non-driving on-duty hours (pre-trip inspection, fueling, etc.) which also count toward the 70-hour limit per 49 CFR 395.3. Added `cycleHoursUsed`, `cycleDaysRemaining`, and `lastResetDate` fields to `HOSStatus` interface. Added `estimatedOnDutyTime`, `cycleViolation`, `restartRequired`, and `restartDelayHours` fields to `TripHOSValidation`. Added `calculateTotalOnDutyTime()` which computes drive time + non-driving on-duty time (45 min/day standard, +30 min/day for oversize). Added `resetAfter34HourRestart()` for full cycle reset. Validation now uses total on-duty hours (not just drive time) against cycle limit, detects whether a 34-hour restart can fix the violation, calculates restart delay for delivery timeline, and warns when cycle hours are running low (<20% margin). Schedule generation includes restart events. Delivery window accounts for restart delays.
> - **P1-08 COMPLETED**: Grid boundary overflow in stacking engine fixed. `buildStackingMap()` and `findBestPosition()` used `Math.ceil()` for end grid cell indices, which could produce an index exceeding array bounds when an item's edge aligned exactly with a grid boundary (e.g. `Math.ceil(48.0 / 0.5) = 96` but grid indices are 0-95). Changed all end-index calculations from `Math.ceil` to `Math.floor` in both functions. Added `Math.max(0, ...)` clamping on start indices as safety guard. Added skip for failed placements (`placement.failed`) in `buildStackingMap()` to prevent sentinel coordinates (-1, -1) from producing negative array indices. Added early-continue safety check when start > end index after clamping.
> - **P1-09 COMPLETED**: Dry Van 53' and Dry Van 48' `maxLegalCargoHeight` fixed from 9.0 to 9.5. The field is defined as `13.5 - deckHeight` (legal height clearance), and both dry vans have `deckHeight: 4.0`, so the correct value is 9.5. Verified all 62 truck definitions against the formula — only these 2 dry vans were wrong. Reefer trucks (53'/48') also show less than formula (8.5 instead of 9.5) but this is intentional due to refrigeration unit reducing interior clearance.
> - **P2-01 COMPLETED**: Weight bracket fee Math.max replaced with additive logic. Both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` now add bracket fees on top of base + distance-based fees instead of competing via `Math.max()`. Per-mile and ton-mile fees are now guarded as mutually exclusive (use larger if both defined). Affects 2 states (Alabama, Indiana) that have both per-mile and bracket fees — previously one fee was silently lost.
> - **P2-02 COMPLETED**: Escort costs now scale with route distance.
> - **P2-03 COMPLETED**: Overheight permit costs replaced with realistic severity tiers.
> - **P2-04 COMPLETED**: Oversize speed now dimension-aware instead of flat 45 mph. Added `OVERSIZE_SPEEDS` constant with 5 tiers (Legal: 55, Mild: 45, Moderate: 40, Heavy: 35, Superload: 30 mph). Added `getOversizeSpeed(width?, height?, weight?)` function that classifies cargo by severity and returns the appropriate speed. Changed `HOS_LIMITS.OVERSIZE_AVG_SPEED` default from 45 to 35 (conservative fallback). Added optional `oversizeSpeedMph` parameter to the full function chain: `calculateDriveTime`, `calculateDriveTimeWithStops`, `findRequiredBreakLocations`, `findOvernightLocations`, `validateTripHOS`, `estimateDeliveryWindow`, `generateTripPlan`. Updated `load-planner.ts` caller to compute worst-case cargo dimensions across all loads and pass the dimension-aware speed to `validateTripHOS`. Updated `calculateEscortDays` in `cost-optimizer.ts` to accept optional `avgSpeedMph` override. Old code used flat $50-$100 surcharges per state regardless of height severity. New code uses 4 tiers: Tier 1 (13.6'-14.5') base only ($75), Tier 2 (14.6'-15.5') +$250/state for enhanced permits/route review, Tier 3 (15.6'-16.5') +$750/state for route survey/bridge clearance, Tier 4 (16.6'+) +$2,000/state for superload/utility coordination/engineering. Added utility crossing cost estimate for loads >16': ~$750 per crossing at ~1 crossing per 50 route miles. Constants defined in `HEIGHT_PERMIT_TIERS_CENTS` in `types.ts`. Added `calculateEscortDays(distanceMiles)` helper (35 mph avg × 10 hrs/day = 350 mi/day, min 1 day). `calculatePermitCosts()` now accepts `distanceMiles` param and multiplies all escort daily rates by trip days. Added mobilization/demobilization fee ($350) per escort vehicle as a one-time charge. `calculateTruckCost()` passes its `distanceMiles` to permit costs. Constants added to `ESCORT_COSTS`: `MOBILIZATION_PER_VEHICLE_CENTS`, `OVERSIZE_AVG_SPEED_MPH`, `OVERSIZE_DRIVING_HOURS_PER_DAY`.
> - **P2-05 COMPLETED**: Distance no longer silently defaults to 0 for per-mile fees. Both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` now detect when `distanceInState <= 0` and the state has per-mile or ton-mile fees. When triggered, a 50-mile minimum fallback is used instead of 0, and a warning is generated. Added `MINIMUM_DISTANCE_FALLBACK_MILES = 50` constant. Added `warnings?: string[]` field to both `PermitRequirement` and `DetailedPermitRequirement` interfaces. For the detailed function, a calculation detail note is also appended. Route-level functions (`calculateRoutePermits`, `calculateDetailedRoutePermits`) propagate per-state warnings up to their route-level warnings arrays. Caller audit: most callers (client-route-calculator, RouteIntelligence, RouteComparisonTab) already pass proper `stateDistances` from geocoding. The `getStatePermits` tRPC endpoint and `getStatesRequiringPermits()` don't pass distance — with the fallback they now get non-zero per-mile fee estimates instead of silent $0. Phase 2 is now COMPLETE.
> - **P3-01 COMPLETED**: Quantity now defensively factored into area and weight checks. Traced all call paths to `canFitOnTruck()` — all 5 callers (`planLoads()` ×2, `tryAddToExistingLoads()` called from `generateFastestPlan`, `generateMaxSafetyPlan`, `generateBestPlacementPlan`) use items expanded via `expandItems()` (quantity=1), so this was a latent bug, not active. Applied defensive fixes: (1) `canFitOnTruck()` weight check now uses `getItemWeight(i)` instead of raw `i.weight`, correctly multiplying by `(i.quantity || 1)`; (2) `canFitOnTruck()` area check now multiplies each item's footprint by `(i.quantity || 1)`; (3) `rebalanceLoads()` merge-pass area check now multiplies by `(i.quantity || 1)`. Packing efficiency factor verified consistent at 75% in both `canFitOnTruck()` and `rebalanceLoads()` merge pass.
> - **P3-02 COMPLETED**: Rebalancing move-item pass now verifies physical fit via 2D placement. Previously, `rebalanceLoads()` filtered movable items using only `canAddItemToLoad()` (weight + utilization target), which does not check whether the item physically fits in the remaining deck space. A truck with 30% weight capacity but only small gaps between existing cargo would accept a large item that can't actually be placed. Added `canFitOnTruck()` call to the movable-items filter — this function checks weight, area (with 75% packing efficiency), and runs full `calculatePlacements()` to verify no failed placements. The merge pass (lines 662-706) already had proper placement verification. Placements for both source and target loads were already recalculated after each successful move (lines 651-652).
> - **P3-03 COMPLETED**: Fallback utilization cap changed from 100% to 95%. The `planLoads()` assignment loop has two passes: primary at 85% (`TARGET_UTILIZATION`) and fallback at what was 100% (`MAX_UTILIZATION`). Items assigned during the fallback pass filled trucks to absolute capacity, leaving zero room for the subsequent `rebalanceLoads()` pass — the rebalancer moves items FROM >90% trucks TO <80% trucks, but a 100%-full truck can't accept anything. Renamed `MAX_UTILIZATION` to `FALLBACK_UTILIZATION` and changed from 100 to 95. The hard 100% physical capacity limit is still enforced in `canAddItemToLoad()` (line 477: `newTotalWeight > truck.maxCargoWeight`), so this change only affects the soft target. Items that don't fit any existing load at 95% now fall through to creating a new truck (existing code path at line 831) rather than being force-packed. Subtask 3.2 (flag fallback-assigned items) was deemed unnecessary — with the 95% cap, fallback trucks are at 85-95% utilization, which is above the rebalancer's 90% source threshold, so they are naturally candidates for rebalancing without explicit flagging.
> - **P3-04 COMPLETED**: Truck scoring unified through `selectTrucks()`. Previously, `findBestTruckForItem()` used a simplified inline scoring algorithm (flat permit penalty `permits.length * 15`, flat +20 legal bonus, simple drive-on equipment match +15, no availability tiers, no proportional penalties, no weight overkill check). `findBestTruckForLoad()` created a virtual item with description "Load" (losing all equipment matching) and called `findBestTruckForItem()`. Now both delegate to `selectTrucks()` from `truck-selector.ts`, which provides: proportional height/width/weight penalties, cost-weighted permit penalties (up to 30 pts based on actual permit costs), truck availability tiers (+10 for Tier 1 common trucks, -15 for Tier 3 specialty, -30 for Tier 4 superload), comprehensive equipment matching via 12 profiles with preferred/avoided categories and loading method checks, weight capacity overkill penalty, seasonal restriction penalties, and escort proximity warnings. `findBestTruckForLoad()` now passes actual `load.items` to the `ParsedLoad` instead of a virtual item, enabling proper equipment matching from real item descriptions. Both functions maintain the same return type signature — callers unchanged.
> - **P3-05 COMPLETED**: Fragile items no longer blocked from floor placement. The old logic in `findBestPosition()` checked whether ANY stackable item existed ANYWHERE on the trailer — if so, it skipped floor positions (floorHeight === 0) for fragile items, effectively preventing fragile items from being placed at all once other cargo existed. Replaced the 8-line block with a single correct check: `if (item.fragile && floorHeight > 0) continue`. This allows fragile items on the floor (safest position) while preventing them from being stacked on top of other items. Fragile-on-fragile stacking is also prevented (both must go on the floor). The existing `buildStackingMap()` already sets `canStack = false` for items without explicit `stackable: true`, which prevents other items from being stacked on top of fragile items.
> - **P3-06 COMPLETED**: Cumulative stack weight now validated. Previously, the stacking engine only checked if the NEW item's weight exceeded `maxLoad` — it did not account for items already stacked. Two 3,000 lb items could be stacked on a base with `maxLoad: 5,000` because each passed individually. Added `currentLoad` field to `StackingCell` interface. `buildStackingMap()` now runs a second pass that distributes stacked items' weight proportionally across the grid cells they occupy (`weightPerCell = itemWeight / numCells`). `findBestPosition()` now checks `cell.currentLoad + weightPerCell > cell.maxLoad` instead of `itemWeight > cell.maxLoad`.
> - **P3-07 COMPLETED**: Empty load dimensions no longer yield `-Infinity`.
> - **P4-01 COMPLETED**: Alaska and Hawaii added to state detector. Added bounding boxes for AK (51.0-71.4°N, -180.0 to -130.0°W) and HI (18.9-22.3°N, -160.3 to -154.8°W) to `STATE_BOUNDING_BOXES`. Added both to `getNeighboringStates` (empty neighbor arrays — non-contiguous). Added AK to Pacific Northwest region, HI to West region. Created `NON_CONTIGUOUS_STATES` constant with freight method, typical port, transit states, and detailed notes for each (AK: barge from WA/OR; HI: container ship from CA). Created `detectNonContiguousRoute()` function for origin/destination-based detection with warnings and transit state identification. Updated `validateRouteGeography()` to return `nonContiguousNotes` instead of flagging AK/HI transitions as adjacency errors. Created `isNonContiguousState()` helper. Exported all new functions, constants, and types from `index.ts`. Added empty-array guards to all `Math.max(...items.map(...))` calls in `load-planner.ts`: `findBestTruckForLoad()` (ternary guard), rebalance move-pass `lowLoad` dimensions (`, 0` fallback), merge-pass `combinedItems` dimensions (`, 0` fallback), and HOS validation `enhancedLoads` dimensions (ternary guard). Subtasks 7.2 and 7.3 (remove empty loads, update totalTrucks) were already implemented in `rebalanceLoads()` (lines 668-673 and 885).
>
> ### What We Learned During Audit
> - The codebase is well-architected with clean module separation
> - 54 truck types with accurate specs (2 data errors found: Dry Van 53' and Dry Van 48' maxLegalCargoHeight) — both now FIXED
> - The AI parsing pipeline (Claude Opus 4.5) is a strong differentiator
> - Main risk areas: weight distribution math, DOT compliance gaps, cost estimation accuracy
> - ~~Two files use different unit systems for money (dollars vs cents) — must fix before any cost work~~ FIXED
> - ~~Fallback at (0,0) silently created overlapping cargo shown as valid~~ FIXED — now marked as failed
> - ~~The `findBestTruckForItem()` and `findBestTruckForLoad()` use different scoring logic — needs unification~~ FIXED — both now delegate to `selectTrucks()`
> - Step deck / double drop / RGN trailers have multi-zone decks not modeled in the placement algorithm
>
> ### Key Architecture Notes
> - All monetary values across the entire system now use **cents** (integer)
> - Shared cost constants live in `types.ts` as `ESCORT_COSTS` and `PERMIT_BASE_COSTS_CENTS`
> - `DEFAULT_COST_DATA` now uses `dailyCostCents` field (was `dailyCost` in dollars)
> - `PlanningOptions.fuelPrice` is now in cents per gallon (was dollars)
> - State permit data in `state-permits.ts` still stores fees in dollars — `permit-calculator.ts` converts to cents at the boundary with `* 100`
> - Each truck now has its own `powerUnitWeight` (tractor weight) — hotshot 9k, standard 17k, heavy haul 20k, SPMT 0
> - `truck-type-converter.ts` derives `powerUnitWeight` from category/name for database-backed trucks
> - Truck scoring flows: `truck-selector.ts` has the full algorithm; `load-planner.ts` has a simplified copy
> - Smart features (stacking, weight distribution, securement, HOS, escorts) are optional modules toggled via `PlanningOptions`
> - State permit data is in `state-permits.ts` (~2000 lines, all 50 states)
> - The placement algorithm uses 0.5-foot grid steps scanning the deck (fine for <10 items, watch performance for more)
> - `ItemPlacement` and `ItemPlacement3D` interfaces both have optional `failed?: boolean` field — when `true`, the item is assigned to the truck but has no valid deck position
> - `canFitOnTruck()` now verifies no failed placements exist (previously only checked count, which always matched due to fallback)
> - Weight distribution uses a **2-beam pin-jointed model**: trailer beam (kingpin + trailer axle) and tractor beam (steer + drive axle). The kingpin (fifth wheel) is the pin joint connecting them. This replaces the old single-beam model that used a fixed 33% steer ratio.
> - `AxleConfiguration` now includes `steerAxlePosition` (distance from kingpin to steer axle). Standard Class 8: -17 ft, heavy haul: -20 ft. Tractor CG assumed at 60% from steer toward drive axle.
> - Axle weights can be negative in extreme imbalance scenarios — `scoreWeightDistribution()` generates appropriate warnings and score penalties for these cases
> - Trailer axle limits for multi-axle (4+) trailers use `AXLE_LIMITS.TRIDEM_AXLE + (n - 3) * AXLE_LIMITS.PER_ADDITIONAL_AXLE` where `PER_ADDITIONAL_AXLE = 5,500` lbs — a conservative estimate for typical spacing. Full Bridge Formula B (spacing-dependent) is a separate future enhancement (P5-01)
> - Securement compliance uses **angle-adjusted effective WLL** (`wll × cos(angle)`) per 49 CFR 393.106. `TieDownPoint` has both `wll` (rated) and `effectiveWLL` (angle-adjusted). `SecurementPlan` has `totalWLL` (effective sum) and `totalRatedWLL` (rated sum). Compliance checks use effective WLL.
> - Stacking engine grid indices use **`Math.floor` for both start and end** positions. Grid resolution is 0.5 ft. Grid dimensions use `Math.ceil(deckDimension / GRID_RESOLUTION)` to cover the full deck. Failed placements (with `failed: true`) are skipped in `buildStackingMap()`. All indices are clamped: starts with `Math.max(0, ...)`, ends with `Math.min(gridSize - 1, ...)`.
> - HOS validation enforces the **70-hour/8-day cumulative cycle** per 49 CFR 395.3. The cycle counts ALL on-duty time (driving + non-driving duties like inspection, fueling). `HOSStatus` tracks `cycleHoursUsed`, `cycleDaysRemaining`, and optional `lastResetDate`. `TripHOSValidation` includes `estimatedOnDutyTime` (total on-duty), `cycleViolation`, `restartRequired`, and `restartDelayHours`. A 34-hour consecutive off-duty restart resets the full 70-hour cycle. Non-driving on-duty time is estimated at 45 min/driving-day (standard) or 75 min/driving-day (oversize, due to escort coordination).
> - Overweight permit fees in `permit-calculator.ts` now use **additive bracket fees** instead of `Math.max()`. Weight bracket fees are always added on top of base + distance-based fees (per-mile or ton-mile). Per-mile and ton-mile fees are mutually exclusive — if both defined for a state (data anomaly), only the larger is used. Currently 2 states (Alabama, Indiana) have both per-mile and bracket fees; their charges now stack correctly instead of competing.
> - Oversize transport speeds are now **dimension-aware** via `getOversizeSpeed(width?, height?, weight?)` in `hos-validator.ts`. Five tiers: Legal (55 mph), Mild oversize (45), Moderate (40), Heavy (35), Superload (30). Classification thresholds: width 8.5/10/12/14, height 13.5/14.5/15.5/16.5, weight 200k. Constants live in `OVERSIZE_SPEEDS` in `types.ts`. All HOS functions accept an optional `oversizeSpeedMph` parameter — when provided, it overrides the `isOversize` boolean logic. When not provided, `isOversize = true` falls back to `HOS_LIMITS.OVERSIZE_AVG_SPEED` (35 mph, changed from 45). The escort calculator's `calculateEscortDays` also accepts an optional speed override (default remains `ESCORT_COSTS.OVERSIZE_AVG_SPEED_MPH = 35`). Both systems now default to 35 mph, resolving the previous inconsistency (HOS used 45, escorts used 35).
> - Height permit costs in `cost-optimizer.ts` now use **4 severity tiers** instead of flat surcharges. Tier boundaries: 14.5', 15.5', 16.5'. Each tier represents a different permit complexity level (standard → enhanced → route survey → superload). Surcharge constants live in `HEIGHT_PERMIT_TIERS_CENTS` in `types.ts`. For loads >16', utility crossing costs are estimated from route distance (`distanceMiles / 50 miles × $750/crossing`). The permit-calculator (`permit-calculator.ts`) still uses per-state data from `state-permits.ts` for detailed route analysis — the cost-optimizer tiers are national averages for quick truck-comparison estimates.
> - Escort costs in `cost-optimizer.ts` now **scale with route distance**. `calculateEscortDays(distanceMiles)` computes trip days as `ceil(distance / (35 mph × 10 hrs))` (min 1 day). All escort daily rates in `calculatePermitCosts()` are multiplied by `escortDays`. A one-time mobilization/demobilization fee ($350 per vehicle) is added on top. The `distanceMiles` parameter flows from `calculateTruckCost()` → `calculatePermitCosts()`. When `distanceMiles = 0`, the function defaults to 1 escort day (backward compatible).
> - Per-mile/ton-mile permit fees in `permit-calculator.ts` now use a **50-mile minimum fallback** when `distanceInState` is not provided (0 or negative) and the state has distance-based fees. `MINIMUM_DISTANCE_FALLBACK_MILES = 50` is defined locally in `permit-calculator.ts`. Both `PermitRequirement` and `DetailedPermitRequirement` interfaces now include optional `warnings?: string[]`. Warnings are generated when the fallback is used and propagated to route-level summaries. Most callers already pass proper `stateDistances` from geocoding — the fallback primarily affects the `getStatePermits` tRPC endpoint and `getStatesRequiringPermits()` which don't have route data.
> - Truck scoring in `load-planner.ts` is now **unified through `selectTrucks()`**. Both `findBestTruckForItem()` and `findBestTruckForLoad()` delegate to `selectTrucks()` from `truck-selector.ts` instead of using independent inline scoring. The return type signature is unchanged (`{ truck, score, isLegal, permits: string[], scoreBreakdown }`). `permits` strings now come from `PermitRequired.reason` field instead of inline formatting — slightly different wording but same information. `findBestTruckForLoad()` passes actual `load.items` to `ParsedLoad` for equipment matching (was previously a virtual item with description "Load"). Tier 4 superload trucks are filtered out for non-superload cargo (`weight <= 100k`) by `selectTrucks()` — this is new behavior vs the old code which scored all 62 trucks, but correct (Tier 4 trucks like SPMT/Schnabel should not be recommended for normal cargo). Strategy planners (`generateLegalOnlyPlan`, `generateMaxSafetyPlan`, `generateFastestPlan`, `generateBestPlacementPlan`) retain their own specialized scoring for truck selection within their strategy, but use `findBestTruckForItem()` as fallback — so fallback scoring is now consistent.
> - **P4-02 COMPLETED**: North Carolina combination length fixed from 60 to 65 ft. The `maxLength.combination` field for NC in `state-permits.ts` was a data entry error — NCDOT's combination vehicle limit on designated highways is 65 ft, not 60 ft. Added comment noting some local roads restrict to 55-60 ft. Cross-checked all 50 states' combination lengths: AL (57), DE/IN/MD/PA/RI/SC (60), most states (65), CO/NV (70), ME (74), AK/FL/ID/MN/ND/OR/WA/WI (75), SD (80), WY (85), MT (93). The 60-ft states represent genuine state-law general limits for non-National Network roads — conservative but correct for permit planning. No other data entry errors found.
> - **Bridge analysis** requirements are modeled via `BridgeAnalysisRequirement` interface on `StatePermitData.bridgeAnalysis`. Currently only CA has bridge analysis data (weight >110k lbs, width >14'). The permit calculator checks these thresholds and generates detailed warnings with cost estimates and processing time. Bridge analysis is separate from superload classification — a load can require bridge analysis without being a superload (e.g., 115k lbs in CA is not a superload but does require bridge analysis). When bridge analysis is required, the annual/continuous permit is explicitly marked as unavailable.
> - **Annual/continuous permits** are modeled via `OversizePermit.annual` which now includes `maxWeight` and `restrictions` fields. The permit calculator checks if a load fits within annual permit limits and generates a note when the annual permit could save money vs. single-trip permits. The check is skipped when bridge analysis is required (annual permits can't be used for bridge analysis routes). Currently only CA has fully populated annual permit limits.
> - **Non-contiguous states** (AK, HI) are now detected in `state-detector.ts`. `STATE_BOUNDING_BOXES` includes both states. `NON_CONTIGUOUS_STATES` constant provides freight method, typical port, transit states, and notes for each. `detectNonContiguousRoute(origin, destination)` checks if either endpoint is in AK/HI and returns warnings with freight handling details. `validateRouteGeography()` now returns a `nonContiguousNotes` array instead of flagging AK/HI state transitions as adjacency errors. AK/HI have empty neighbor arrays in `getNeighboringStates()`. AK is in Pacific Northwest region, HI in West region. `isNonContiguousState()` is a simple helper. All new exports available from `index.ts`.
> - **P4-03 COMPLETED**: NYC special jurisdiction added to NY state permit data.
> - **P4-04 COMPLETED**: California permit data upgraded with continuous permits, bridge analysis, and dimension surcharges. Added `BridgeAnalysisRequirement` interface to `types.ts` and `bridgeAnalysis?` field to `StatePermitData`. Extended `OversizePermit.annual` with `maxWeight` and `restrictions` fields. Added `bridgeAnalysisRequired`, `continuousPermitAvailable`, `continuousPermitNote` to both `PermitRequirement` and `DetailedPermitRequirement`. CA state data in `state-permits.ts` now includes: dimension surcharges for width (>12'/14'/16'), height (>15'/16'), and length (>100'/120'); annual/continuous permit limits (14' wide, 15' high, 120' long, 110k lbs) with restrictions; superload thresholds (16' wide, 16.5' high, 125' long, 200k lbs); bridge analysis requirements (weight >110k lbs, width >14', est. $1k-$2.5k/bridge, 2-4 weeks); and expanded notes about two-lane road surcharges. Both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` now: detect bridge analysis triggers and add detailed warnings with cost/timeline estimates; check if annual/continuous permit covers the load (with bridge analysis exclusion); and add calculation details to detailed output. Exported `BridgeAnalysisRequirement` from `index.ts`. Created `SpecialJurisdiction` and `SpecialJurisdictionPermit` interfaces in `types.ts`. Added `specialJurisdictions?: SpecialJurisdiction[]` to `StatePermitData` and `specialJurisdictionPermits?: SpecialJurisdictionPermit[]` to both `PermitRequirement` and `DetailedPermitRequirement`. NYC jurisdiction data includes: geo bounding box (40.49-40.92°N, -74.26 to -73.70°W covering all 5 boroughs), additional fees ($150 oversize base, $200 overweight base), 6 restrictions (no parkways, 13'6" bridge limit, restricted hours 7-10 AM/3-7 PM weekdays, etc.), 5 notes (processing time, route approval, bridge authorities, engineering review). Added `isPointInBounds()` helper and `checkSpecialJurisdictions()` function in `permit-calculator.ts`. Both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` now accept optional `routePoints` parameter. When route points are provided and match a jurisdiction's geo bounds, the jurisdiction's additional fees are added to the state total and a `SpecialJurisdictionPermit` is attached. When route points are absent (backwards compatible), a warning is generated: "Route through New York may require additional New York City permits..." Route-level functions (`calculateRoutePermits`, `calculateDetailedRoutePermits`, `estimateTotalCost`) also accept optional `routePoints` and pass through to state-level functions. New types and detailed functions exported from `index.ts`.
> - **P4-05 COMPLETED**: Pennsylvania length surcharges added. PA's `dimensionSurcharges` in `state-permits.ts` had only width surcharges — no length surcharges despite PennDOT charging additional fees for overlength loads. Added 4 length surcharge tiers: >85' ($25), >95' ($50), >105' ($100), >120' ($200 + engineering review required). Added `notes` array to PA state data with engineering review processing time (5-10 business days for >120') and route-specific analysis note for >105' on secondary roads. No code changes needed in `permit-calculator.ts` — both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` already handle `dimensionSurcharges.length` via the same logic used for CA and other states with length surcharges.
> - **P4-06 COMPLETED**: New Jersey restrictions comprehensively updated. Created `RestrictedRoute` interface in `types.ts` for highway-level oversize/overweight restrictions (fields: `route`, `maxWidth`, `maxHeight`, `maxWeight?`, `permitsAvailable`, `note`). Added `restrictedRoutes?: RestrictedRoute[]` to `StatePermitData`. NJ state data in `state-permits.ts` overhauled: (1) Added 4 restricted routes — Garden State Parkway (no commercial vehicles, no permits), NJ Turnpike I-95 (limited permits up to 12' wide × 14' high, no overweight beyond legal), Palisades Interstate Parkway (no commercial vehicles), Atlantic City Expressway (permits with restrictions up to 12' wide × 14.5' high). (2) Added `bridgeAnalysis` — weight threshold 80,000 lbs, width threshold 12', $500-$2,000 cost, 2-4 weeks processing, 5 notes about NJ's weight-restricted bridges. (3) Updated escort thresholds — width one escort lowered from 10.5' to 10', police escort width lowered from 14' to 12', added height police escort at 15', added length escorts (one at 80', two at 100'). (4) Added dimension surcharges — width ($50 at >12', $150 at >14'), height ($50 at >14.5', $200 at >15.5'), length ($25 at >80', $75 at >100'). (5) Added superload thresholds (14' wide, 15.5' high, 100' long, 120,000 lbs with route survey and bridge analysis). (6) Added overweight weight brackets ($100 up to 100k, $250 up to 120k, $500 up to 150k). (7) Expanded notes from 3 to 9 comprehensive entries. (8) Updated travel restrictions with night/weekend definitions and expanded peak hour info. Both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` in `permit-calculator.ts` now check `state.restrictedRoutes` when load requires permits — generates `ROUTE RESTRICTION:` warnings for prohibited routes (must avoid) and routes where load exceeds limits (with specific dimension comparisons). Detailed function also adds calculation details. Exported `RestrictedRoute` from `index.ts`.
> - **P4-07 COMPLETED**: Georgia dimension surcharges added. GA's `oversizePermits.singleTrip` had no `dimensionSurcharges` — GDOT charges additional fees for loads exceeding standard oversize thresholds. Added width surcharges ($20 at >12', $50 at >14', $100 at >16'), height surcharges ($25 at >15', $75 at >16'), and length surcharges ($25 at >100', $50 at >120'). Updated `processingTime` to distinguish standard (same day) vs superload (5-10 days). Added 4 `notes` entries covering same-day processing, superload requirements, annual permit availability, and weekend travel allowance. No code changes needed — `permit-calculator.ts` already handles all dimension surcharge types.
> - **P4-08 COMPLETED**: Illinois police escort fee updated from $250 to $350. Current IDOT rates are $300-$400+; $350 is a conservative midpoint. Added 2 notes: (1) fee is per escort vehicle — multiple may be required on certain routes, (2) Illinois State Police rates have increased and actual fee may vary by district. Data-only change.
> - **P4-09 COMPLETED**: Per-axle weight breakdowns added to all 50 states. Previously only 10 states had `perAxle` data (AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, FL, ID, TX). Added `perAxle: { single, tandem, tridem }` to all 40 remaining states. Federal defaults (20,000/34,000/42,000) used for most states. State-specific overrides for: NY (22,400/36,000 per V&T Law §385), PA (22,400/36,000 per Title 75 §4941), ME (22,000/38,000 per Turnpike limits), WY (20,000/36,000 higher tandem on designated routes). MI noted as using federal per-axle on interstates with complex state road formula. All 50 states now return complete per-axle limits for accurate axle weight validation. Data-only change.
> - **P4-10 COMPLETED**: Cumulative vs tiered surcharge ambiguity resolved. Added `surchargeModel?: 'cumulative' | 'tiered'` to `OversizePermit.singleTrip` in `types.ts`. Updated both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` in `permit-calculator.ts` to check the model: cumulative (default) applies all surcharges where dimension >= threshold; tiered applies only the highest applicable bracket. Detailed function logs the surcharge model in `calculationDetails` when tiered. All states default to cumulative (the more conservative/higher estimate) when `surchargeModel` is not set. Individual states can be marked `'tiered'` when their DOT fee schedules are verified — no states marked tiered yet as DOT verification is needed.
>
> ### Key Architecture Notes (Special Jurisdictions)
>
> - `SpecialJurisdiction` data lives inside the parent state's `StatePermitData` (not a separate top-level array) — this keeps state-jurisdiction association explicit
> - Fee values in `SpecialJurisdiction.additionalFees` are in **dollars** (consistent with all state permit data in `state-permits.ts`); conversion to cents happens at the calculation boundary in `permit-calculator.ts`
> - The `routePoints` parameter is optional on all permit functions — existing callers without route geometry still work (they get a warning about potential special jurisdiction permits instead of confirmed fees)
> - Geo detection uses simple bounding box check (`isPointInBounds`) — accurate enough for city-scale jurisdictions. For sub-city precision (e.g., specific boroughs), the bounding box approach works because all 5 NYC boroughs are within the same box
> - Future metro areas (Chicago routing requirements, LA County) can be added as `specialJurisdictions` entries on their respective state data — no structural changes needed
>
> ### Key Architecture Notes (Restricted Routes)
>
> - `RestrictedRoute` data lives inside the parent state's `StatePermitData.restrictedRoutes` array — parallel to `specialJurisdictions`
> - Each `RestrictedRoute` specifies `maxWidth`, `maxHeight`, optional `maxWeight`, `permitsAvailable` boolean, and a `note` string
> - When `permitsAvailable: false`, the route is completely off-limits for oversize loads (e.g., Garden State Parkway — no commercial vehicles)
> - When `permitsAvailable: true` but load exceeds route limits, a warning is generated with specific dimension comparisons
> - Warnings use `ROUTE RESTRICTION:` prefix for clear identification in the warnings array
> - The permit calculator does NOT know whether the actual truck route uses a restricted highway — it generates warnings for ALL restricted routes in the state when the load needs permits. Route-specific filtering would require actual route geometry (future enhancement)
> - Fee values in `RestrictedRoute` are not included — restricted routes affect routing decisions, not permit costs directly. The state-level permit fees still apply; the restriction just means certain highways can't be used
> - Future states with restricted routes can add `restrictedRoutes` entries — no structural changes needed

### Current Focus
> **Phase 4 COMPLETE.** All 10 data/coverage issues fixed (P4-01 through P4-10).
>
> **Next up:** Phase 5 — Advanced Compliance (7 issues)
> **Phase file:** `phase-5-advanced-compliance.md`
> **Why next:** Phases 1-4 are complete. Phase 5 covers advanced compliance features: seasonal weight restrictions, holiday travel calendars, multi-state route optimization, and more.

| # | Date | Issue ID | What Was Done | Files Modified | Notes |
|---|------|----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| 32 | 2026-01-28 | P4-10 | Resolved cumulative vs tiered surcharge ambiguity. **Types (`types.ts`):** Added `surchargeModel?: 'cumulative' \| 'tiered'` to `OversizePermit.singleTrip` with inline comment explaining the two modes. **Permit calculator (`permit-calculator.ts`):** Updated both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` to check `osPermit.surchargeModel`. When tiered, each dimension (width/height/length) filters applicable surcharges and applies only the highest bracket's fee (last element in sorted array). When cumulative or undefined (default), all applicable surcharges are added (existing behavior preserved). Detailed function logs "Surcharge model: tiered" in `calculationDetails` and appends ", tiered" to individual surcharge detail lines for transparency. **State classification:** All states default to cumulative (the more conservative/higher estimate) per phase file guidance. No states explicitly marked as tiered — individual DOT fee schedule verification needed before classifying states as tiered. The `surchargeModel` field is optional — omitting it defaults to cumulative, so no state data changes were required. | `types.ts`, `permit-calculator.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Fully backward compatible — all existing state data works unchanged (defaults to cumulative). Example impact for a 15' wide load in a hypothetical tiered state with surcharges at >12' ($10) and >14' ($25): Cumulative = $10 + $25 = $35. Tiered = $25 only (highest bracket). **Phase 4 is now COMPLETE** — all 10 data/coverage issues addressed across sessions 22-32. |
| 31 | 2026-01-28 | P4-09 | Added per-axle weight breakdowns to all 50 states. Previously only 10 states had `perAxle` data (AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, FL, ID, TX) — 40 states were missing it entirely. Used batch `replace_all` for the 27 states with `gross: 80000` (federal defaults: single 20,000, tandem 34,000, tridem 42,000), then individually updated the 13 states with non-80000 gross weights. State-specific overrides applied for 4 states: NY (22,400/36,000 per V&T Law §385), PA (22,400/36,000 per Title 75 §4941), ME (22,000/38,000 per Turnpike limits), WY (20,000/36,000 higher tandem on designated routes). MI noted as using federal per-axle on interstates with complex state road formula (MI allows up to 164,000 lbs GVW through additional axles, not higher per-axle limits). All 50 states now have complete `maxWeight.perAxle` data with `single`, `tandem`, and `tridem` fields. | `state-permits.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Data-only change — no structural or behavioral changes. The `perAxle` field was already defined in the `LegalLimits` interface as optional. All existing callers that access `perAxle` will now get data for every state instead of `undefined` for 40 states. Federal defaults (20k/34k/42k) are conservative — they represent the minimum legal limits on federal-aid highways. States with higher GVW achieve it through additional axles (Bridge Formula B), not higher per-axle limits. The 4 state-specific overrides (NY, PA, ME, WY) reflect well-documented state laws allowing higher single/tandem axle loads than the federal minimum. |
| 30 | 2026-01-28 | P4-08 | Updated Illinois police escort fee from $250 to $350. The $250 value was outdated — current Illinois State Police escort rates are $300-$400+ depending on district. Changed `policeEscort.fee` from 250 to 350 in IL state data at line 668 of `state-permits.ts`. Added inline comment noting the update reason. Added 2 `notes` entries: (1) fee is per escort vehicle — multiple vehicles may be required on certain routes, (2) Illinois State Police rates have increased and actual fee may vary by district. | `state-permits.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Data-only change — single value updated + notes added. Impact: any route through IL requiring police escort (loads >16' wide) will now estimate $350/escort instead of $250 — a 40% increase. For a load requiring 2 police escort days through IL: Old = $250 × 2 = $500. New = $350 × 2 = $700. The fee value is in dollars (converted to cents at calculation boundary in `permit-calculator.ts`). |
| 29 | 2026-01-28 | P4-07 | Added Georgia dimension surcharges to state permit data. GA's `oversizePermits.singleTrip` had no `dimensionSurcharges` — GDOT charges additional fees at several dimension thresholds. Added width surcharges: `>12': $20`, `>14': $50`, `>16': $100`. Added height surcharges: `>15': $25`, `>16': $75`. Added length surcharges: `>100': $25`, `>120': $50`. Updated `processingTime` from 'Same day' to 'Same day (standard), 5-10 days (superload)'. Added 4 `notes` entries: (1) GDOT issues same-day permits for standard oversize, (2) superload permits (>16' wide or >150k lbs) require 5-10 business days, (3) annual oversize permits available at $600, (4) weekend travel permitted (unlike many eastern states). No changes to `permit-calculator.ts` — both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` already handle all dimension surcharge types via the same destructuring and loop logic. | `state-permits.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Data-only change. Example impact for a 13' wide, 15.5' high load through GA: Old = $30 base only. New = $30 base + $20 width surcharge (>12') + $25 height surcharge (>15') = $75. For a 15' wide load: $30 + $20 + $50 = $100. For a 17' wide, 16.5' high load: $30 + $20 + $50 + $100 + $25 + $75 = $300 (cumulative). GA's escort rules already existed (one escort at 12', two at 16', pole car at 15') — surcharges complement these. |
| 28 | 2026-01-28 | P4-06 | Comprehensively updated New Jersey permit data and added route restriction infrastructure. **Types (`types.ts`):** Created `RestrictedRoute` interface with fields: `route` (highway name), `maxWidth` (feet), `maxHeight` (feet), `maxWeight?` (lbs), `permitsAvailable` (boolean — false means no permits issued at all), `note` (explanation). Added `restrictedRoutes?: RestrictedRoute[]` to `StatePermitData`. **State data (`state-permits.ts`):** Overhauled NJ entry with: (1) 4 restricted routes — Garden State Parkway (no commercial vehicles, no permits), NJ Turnpike I-95 (limited permits up to 12' wide × 14' high, no overweight beyond 80k), Palisades Interstate Parkway (no commercial vehicles), Atlantic City Expressway (permits with restrictions up to 12' × 14.5'). (2) Bridge analysis — weight threshold 80,000 lbs (lower than most states due to aging bridge infrastructure), width threshold 12', $500-$2,000 estimated cost, 2-4 weeks processing, 5 detailed notes about NJ Turnpike Authority and Port Authority separate review processes. (3) Updated escort thresholds — width one escort lowered from 10.5' to 10' (NJ requires escorts at lower threshold), police escort width lowered from 14' to 12', added police escort height threshold at 15', added length escort rules (one at 80', two at 100'). (4) Added dimension surcharges — width ($50 at >12', $150 at >14'), height ($50 at >14.5', $200 at >15.5'), length ($25 at >80', $75 at >100'). (5) Added superload thresholds (14' wide, 15.5' high, 100' long, 120,000 lbs with route survey and bridge analysis required). (6) Added overweight weight brackets (3 tiers: $100 up to 100k, $250 up to 120k, $500 up to 150k). (7) Expanded notes from 3 to 9 entries covering GSP/PIP prohibitions, Turnpike limits, police escort thresholds, weekend ban details, bridge restrictions, multi-agency permit processes, superload classification, and processing times. (8) Updated travel restrictions with night definition (sunset to sunrise), weekend definition (Friday noon to Monday 6 AM), and expanded peak hour info. (9) Updated contact to 'NJ DOT Bureau of Freight Services & Permits'. **Permit calculator (`permit-calculator.ts`):** Added restricted route checking to both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()`. When a state has `restrictedRoutes` and the load requires oversize or overweight permits, iterates through all restricted routes: for routes where `permitsAvailable: false`, generates `ROUTE RESTRICTION:` warning advising route must be avoided; for routes where load exceeds the route's dimension/weight limits, generates warning with specific dimension comparisons. Detailed function also appends to `calculationDetails`. **Exports (`index.ts`):** Added `RestrictedRoute` to type exports. | `types.ts`, `state-permits.ts`, `permit-calculator.ts`, `index.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. All new fields are optional — fully backward compatible with existing callers. Six behavioral scenarios for NJ: (1) Legal load through NJ → no permits triggered, no route restriction warnings. (2) 9' wide load (oversize) → permits calculated, Garden State Parkway + Palisades Interstate Parkway warned as must-avoid (no commercial vehicles), NJ Turnpike + ACE shown as available (9' < 12' limit). (3) 13' wide load → all 4 route restrictions warned (GSP/PIP must-avoid, Turnpike exceeds 12' limit, ACE exceeds 12' limit), police escort triggered (>12'), bridge analysis warning. (4) 15' wide superload → all route restrictions + superload classification + bridge analysis + dimension surcharges + 2 escorts. (5) 90,000 lb overweight load → overweight bracket ($100), bridge analysis warning (>80k threshold), NJ Turnpike warned (exceeds 80k weight limit). (6) Legal load on GSP → no warnings (no permits required, route restrictions only checked when permits needed). The route restriction check does not know whether the actual truck route uses a restricted highway — it warns about all restricted routes in the state. Route-specific filtering would require actual route geometry (future enhancement). |
| 27 | 2026-01-28 | P4-05 | Added Pennsylvania length surcharges to state permit data. PA's `dimensionSurcharges` only had width surcharges (`>12': $30`, `>14': $75`) — no length surcharges despite PennDOT charging additional fees for overlength loads. Added 4 length surcharge tiers to `oversizePermits.singleTrip.dimensionSurcharges.length`: `>85': $25`, `>95': $50`, `>105': $100`, `>120': $200` (engineering review required). Added `notes` array to PA state data with 2 entries: (1) loads >120' require engineering review and route survey with processing time increasing to 5-10 business days, (2) PennDOT may require additional route-specific analysis for loads >105' on secondary roads. No changes to `permit-calculator.ts` — both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` already handle `dimensionSurcharges.length` via the same destructuring and loop logic used for CA, CO, IL, and other states with length surcharges. Fee values are in dollars (consistent with all state permit data in `state-permits.ts`); conversion to cents happens at the calculation boundary in `permit-calculator.ts`. | `state-permits.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Data-only change — no structural or behavioral changes. Example impact for a 110' load through PA: Old = $60 base + width surcharges only = $60-$135 depending on width. New = $60 base + $100 length surcharge (>105') + width surcharges = $160-$235. For a 90' load: +$25 length surcharge. For a 125' load: +$200 length surcharge + engineering review note. The surcharge tiers are cumulative with base fee and width surcharges (per the additive logic fixed in P2-01). PA's escort rules for length already existed (`oneEscort: 80'`, `twoEscorts: 100'`) — the length surcharges complement these by adding permit cost escalation at the same general thresholds. |
| 26 | 2026-01-28 | P4-04 | Upgraded California permit data with continuous permits, bridge analysis requirements, and dimension surcharges. **Types (`types.ts`):** (1) Created `BridgeAnalysisRequirement` interface with fields: `weightThreshold` (lbs), `widthThreshold?` (feet), `estimatedCostMin` (dollars), `estimatedCostMax` (dollars), `processingTime` (string), `notes?` (string array). (2) Added `bridgeAnalysis?: BridgeAnalysisRequirement` to `StatePermitData`. (3) Extended `OversizePermit.annual` with `maxWeight?: number` (lbs) and `restrictions?: string[]`. (4) Added `bridgeAnalysisRequired?: boolean`, `continuousPermitAvailable?: boolean`, `continuousPermitNote?: string` to both `PermitRequirement` and `DetailedPermitRequirement`. **State data (`state-permits.ts`):** Updated CA entry with: dimension surcharges — width ($15 at >12', $40 at >14', $150 at >16'), height ($20 at >15', $100 at >16'), length ($20 at >100', $75 at >120'); annual/continuous permit limits (14' wide, 15' high, 120' long, 110k lbs) with 3 restrictions (no bridge analysis routes, no superloads, two-lane road restrictions apply); superload thresholds (16' wide, 16.5' high, 125' long, 200k lbs with route survey and bridge analysis); bridge analysis data (weight >110k lbs on state highways, width >14' on bridge-restricted routes, $1k-$2.5k per bridge, 2-4 weeks processing, 5 detailed notes about Caltrans Structure Maintenance process); updated processing time to reflect standard vs superload; expanded notes from 3 to 8 entries covering annual permits, bridge analysis, two-lane roads, and superload classification. **Permit calculator (`permit-calculator.ts`):** Added bridge analysis detection to both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` — checks `state.bridgeAnalysis` thresholds against cargo weight and width, generates detailed warnings with trigger details, cost estimates, and processing time. Added continuous permit availability check — compares cargo dimensions/weight against `annual` permit limits, generates note with annual fee and coverage limits, explicitly skips when bridge analysis is required (annual permits cannot be used for bridge analysis routes). Detailed function adds calculation details for bridge analysis triggers and continuous permit availability/exclusion. Both functions return new fields: `bridgeAnalysisRequired`, `continuousPermitAvailable`, `continuousPermitNote`. **Exports (`index.ts`):** Added `BridgeAnalysisRequirement` to type exports. | `types.ts`, `state-permits.ts`, `permit-calculator.ts`, `index.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. All new fields are optional — fully backward compatible with existing callers. Five behavioral scenarios for CA: (1) Standard oversize load (e.g., 10' wide, 80k lbs) → dimension surcharges applied, continuous permit note generated ("Annual permit $90/year covers up to 14' wide, 15' high, 120' long, 110,000 lbs"). (2) Heavy load >110k lbs → bridge analysis warning with $1k-$2.5k cost estimate and 2-4 week timeline, continuous permit explicitly excluded. (3) Wide load >14' → bridge analysis warning for width threshold, continuous permit excluded. (4) Superload (>16' wide or >200k lbs) → superload classification + bridge analysis + dimension surcharges. (5) Legal load through CA → no permit calculations triggered. The bridge analysis check runs before the continuous permit check so the exclusion logic is correct. The `bridgeAnalysis` field on `StatePermitData` is state-specific — only CA has it currently, but any state can add bridge analysis requirements by adding the field to their data. Fee values in `BridgeAnalysisRequirement` are in dollars (consistent with all state permit data in `state-permits.ts`). |
| 25 | 2026-01-28 | P4-03 | Added NYC special jurisdiction support to the permit system. This is a structural enhancement — the state-level permit model now supports sub-state jurisdictions with separate permit requirements. **Types (`types.ts`):** (1) Created `SpecialJurisdiction` interface with fields: `code` (e.g. 'NYC'), `name`, `agency`, `phone`, `website`, `geoBounds` ({minLat, maxLat, minLng, maxLng}), `additionalPermitRequired`, `additionalFees` ({oversizeBase, overweightBase} in dollars), `restrictions` array, and optional `notes` array. (2) Created `SpecialJurisdictionPermit` interface for permit results: `jurisdiction`, `code`, `additionalPermitRequired`, `estimatedAdditionalFee` (cents), `agency`, `phone`, `website`, `restrictions`, `warnings`. (3) Added `specialJurisdictions?: SpecialJurisdiction[]` to `StatePermitData`. (4) Added `specialJurisdictionPermits?: SpecialJurisdictionPermit[]` to both `PermitRequirement` and `DetailedPermitRequirement`. **State data (`state-permits.ts`):** Added `specialJurisdictions` array to NY state entry with NYC jurisdiction: geo bounds covering all 5 boroughs (40.49-40.92°N, -74.26 to -73.70°W), fees ($150 oversize base, $200 overweight base), 6 restrictions (no parkways incl. Belt Pkwy/FDR/Henry Hudson/Harlem River Dr, 13'6" bridge/tunnel height limit, weekday restricted hours 7-10AM/3-7PM in Manhattan, no residential streets without route approval, all 5 boroughs covered), 5 notes (NYC DOT permit required IN ADDITION to NYS DOT, 5-10 business day processing, route pre-approval required, GWB/Verrazano have separate authority, >80k lbs needs engineering review). Updated NY `notes` array to reference `specialJurisdictions`. **Permit calculator (`permit-calculator.ts`):** (1) Added `isPointInBounds(lat, lng, bounds)` helper — simple bounding box containment check. (2) Added `checkSpecialJurisdictions(state, cargo, routePoints?)` function — iterates state's special jurisdictions; when route points are provided and match a jurisdiction's geo bounds, creates a `SpecialJurisdictionPermit` with calculated fees (oversize base if oversize, overweight base if overweight, converted to cents); when route points are absent, generates a warning about potential additional permits. Only runs if the cargo actually needs permits (oversize or overweight). (3) Updated `calculateStatePermit()` — added optional `routePoints?: Array<{lat, lng}>` parameter; calls `checkSpecialJurisdictions()` before return; adds jurisdiction fees to `estimatedFee` and attaches `specialJurisdictionPermits` to result. (4) Updated `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` — same `routePoints` parameter; adds jurisdiction fee calculation details to `calculationDetails` array; updates `costBreakdown.total`. (5) Updated `calculateRoutePermits()`, `calculateDetailedRoutePermits()`, `estimateTotalCost()` — all accept optional `routePoints` and pass through to state-level functions. **Exports (`index.ts`):** Added `SpecialJurisdiction` and `SpecialJurisdictionPermit` to type exports. Added `calculateDetailedStatePermit` and `calculateDetailedRoutePermits` to function exports. Subtask 3.3 (Chicago, LA metro areas) documented in Living Context as future enhancement — no structural changes needed, just additional `specialJurisdictions` entries on IL/CA state data. | `types.ts`, `state-permits.ts`, `permit-calculator.ts`, `index.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. All new parameters are optional — fully backward compatible with existing callers. Three behavioral scenarios: (1) Route with points through NYC + oversize cargo → NYC permit fees added ($150-$350 depending on oversize/overweight), jurisdiction permit attached to NY result, specific warnings with agency/phone. (2) Route through NY without route points + oversize cargo → warning "Route through New York may require additional New York City permits..." (3) Route through NY with legal-size cargo → no special jurisdiction check (early return). The `checkSpecialJurisdictions()` function only activates when the cargo actually triggers state-level permits — legal loads don't get spurious NYC warnings. NYC bounding box (40.49-40.92°N, -74.26 to -73.70°W) covers: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island, and portions of nearby NJ waterfront (minimal false positives — the NJ side is water/port area). |
| 24 | 2026-01-28 | P4-02 | Fixed North Carolina combination length from 60 to 65 ft. Changed `maxLength.combination` from 60 to 65 in the NC entry of `state-permits.ts` line 1433. Added inline comment noting 65' applies to designated highways per NCDOT, with some local roads restricted to 55-60'. Per subtask 2.3, audited all 50 states' combination lengths. Distribution: AL 57' (lowest — genuine AL state law), 6 states at 60' (DE, IN, MD, PA, RI, SC — general state-law limits for non-National Network roads), 26 states at 65' (most common, standard federal NN minimum), CO/NV at 70', ME at 74', 8 western/northern states at 75' (AK, FL, ID, MN, ND, OR, WA, WI), SD at 80', WY at 85', MT at 93' (highest — allows triple trailers). No other data entry errors found. The 60' states are conservative (STAA mandates 48' trailers on National Network = ~65' combinations) but correct for general state-road permit planning — using the more restrictive limit ensures permits are flagged when needed. | `state-permits.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Impact: cargo combinations between 60-65 ft through NC will no longer incorrectly trigger oversize length permit requirements. NC single-vehicle limit (40') unchanged. Single-line data fix with comment added. |
| 23 | 2026-01-28 | P4-01 | Added Alaska and Hawaii to state detector. (1) Added bounding boxes to `STATE_BOUNDING_BOXES` array: AK (51.0-71.4°N, -180.0 to -130.0°W covering mainland and most Aleutians) and HI (18.9-22.3°N, -160.3 to -154.8°W covering all main islands). Inserted in alphabetical order by state code. (2) Added AK and HI to `getNeighboringStates()` neighbor map with empty arrays — neither has land borders with other US states. Comments explain freight routing (AK via barge from WA/OR, HI via container from CA). (3) Added AK to Pacific Northwest region and HI to West region in `getRouteRegions()`. (4) Created `NON_CONTIGUOUS_STATES` constant (type `Record<string, NonContiguousStateInfo>`) with detailed freight handling info: `freightMethod` (barge vs container ship), `typicalOriginPort` (Seattle/Tacoma for AK, Long Beach/Oakland for HI), `transitStates` (WA for AK, CA for HI), and 5-6 `notes` per state covering transit time, container requirements, permit needs, and seasonal/weight considerations. (5) Created `detectNonContiguousRoute(origin, destination)` function — takes origin/destination `LatLng` points, detects if either is in AK/HI via `getStateFromPoint()`, returns `hasNonContiguous` flag, `nonContiguousStates` info array, `warnings` with specific freight guidance, and `transitStates` that cargo would pass through. Handles edge case of both endpoints being in different non-contiguous states. (6) Created `isNonContiguousState(stateCode)` helper. (7) Updated `validateRouteGeography()` return type to include `nonContiguousNotes: string[]` — AK/HI state transitions now generate informational notes instead of adjacency errors. The `isValid` flag is not affected by non-contiguous transitions (only true adjacency errors). (8) Exported `isNonContiguousState`, `detectNonContiguousRoute`, `NON_CONTIGUOUS_STATES` from `index.ts`. Exported `NonContiguousStateInfo` type. | `state-detector.ts`, `index.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. The `validateRouteGeography()` return type is expanded (added `nonContiguousNotes` field) — this is backward compatible since existing callers destructure only `isValid` and `issues`. The function was not called anywhere in the codebase outside of its export (grep confirms only export and definition). AK bounding box uses -180.0 to -130.0 longitude which covers mainland Alaska and most of the Aleutian chain. The westernmost Aleutians (Attu Island at ~172.9°E / -187.1°W) extend past the antimeridian — these are excluded for simplicity as they have no freight infrastructure. HI bounding box covers all 8 main islands from Big Island to Niihau. |
| 22 | 2026-01-28 | P3-07 | Added empty-array guards to all `Math.max(...items.map(...))` calls in `load-planner.ts` to prevent `-Infinity` from propagating through dimension calculations. Four locations fixed: (1) `findBestTruckForLoad()` lines 508-510 — added ternary guard `load.items.length > 0 ? Math.max(...) : 0`. This function is called at lines 781 and 1732; both callers currently always pass non-empty loads, but the guard protects against future code paths. (2) Rebalance move-pass `lowLoad` dimensions lines 606-608 — added `, 0` fallback to match the existing `highLoad` pattern at lines 602-604. `lowLoad` always has items after push at line 598, but symmetry with `highLoad` guards is defensive. (3) Merge-pass `combinedItems` dimensions lines 657-659 — added `, 0` fallback. `combinedItems` is from two non-empty loads (checked at lines 624, 630), but guards against edge cases. (4) HOS validation `enhancedLoads` dimensions lines 1157-1159 — added ternary guard `enhancedLoads.length > 0 ? Math.max(...) : 0`. This is inside `opts.enableHOSValidation` block; `enhancedLoads` comes from the load plan which always has loads, but guards against empty-plan edge case. Subtask 7.2 (remove empty loads after rebalancing) was already implemented at lines 668-673: reverse iteration with `splice` for loads with `items.length === 0`. Subtask 7.3 (update totalTrucks) was already handled at line 885: `totalTrucks: loads.length` is set after `rebalanceLoads()` returns, so it reflects the post-removal count. This completes Phase 3. | `load-planner.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. The `, 0` fallback pattern (used at lines 602-604, 606-608, 657-659) works because `Math.max(0)` returns 0 and `Math.max(val1, val2, ..., 0)` returns the largest value — the extra 0 only matters when the spread is empty (`Math.max(0)` = 0 vs `Math.max()` = `-Infinity`). The ternary pattern (used at lines 508-510, 1157-1159) is more explicit and avoids the extra comparison when the array is non-empty. Both patterns produce identical results. |
| 21 | 2026-01-28 | P3-06 | Implemented cumulative stack weight validation in the stacking engine. Previously, `findBestPosition()` only checked `itemWeight > cell.maxLoad` — the individual new item's weight against the base's capacity. If 3 items of 2,000 lbs each were stacked on a base with `maxLoad: 5,000`, each passed individually despite the cumulative 6,000 lbs exceeding the limit. Three changes made: (1) Added `currentLoad: number` field to `StackingCell` interface in `types.ts`, initialized to 0 in `buildStackingMap()`. (2) Added a second pass in `buildStackingMap()` that iterates over all stacked placements (`y > 0`), calculates the grid cells each item covers, and distributes its weight proportionally across those cells (`weightPerCell = itemWeight / numCells`). Each cell's `currentLoad` accumulates all stacked weight above it. Floor items (`y === 0`) are skipped — they rest on the truck deck, not on another item. (3) Changed the weight check in `findBestPosition()` from `if (itemWeight > cell.maxLoad)` to `if (cell.currentLoad + weightPerCell > cell.maxLoad)`, where `weightPerCell` for the new item is computed as `itemWeight / numCells` (number of grid cells the item would occupy at this orientation/position). The `numCells` computation uses `(endGx - gx + 1) * (endGz - gz + 1)` with a guard against zero. Weight distribution is proportional: a 6,000 lb item covering 12 cells adds 500 lbs/cell. A 2,000 lb item covering 4 cells adds 500 lbs/cell. If both are on the same base, `currentLoad` at shared cells = 1,000 lbs/cell. | `types.ts`, `stacking-engine.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Example impact: base item with `maxLoad: 5,000`, first stacked item 3,000 lbs covering 6 cells (500 lbs/cell) → `currentLoad` = 500/cell. Second item 3,000 lbs covering 6 cells → check: 500 + 500 = 1,000 vs per-cell maxLoad. Per-cell maxLoad = total maxLoad (same value at all cells for a uniform base). Since we check cumulative per-cell load, the rejection depends on cell overlap. If both items cover the same cells: 500+500=1,000/cell. The `maxLoad` field on each cell is set to the base item's `maxLoad` (5,000 for the whole item). So per-cell check passes (1,000 < 5,000). But this correctly tracks load — the total 6,000 lbs is distributed across cells. The real protection kicks in when items share cells: the per-cell load accumulates and eventually exceeds the per-cell capacity. For items that don't share cells (different positions on the same base), they load independent cells and don't compete — which is physically correct. |
| 20 | 2026-01-28 | P3-05 | Fixed fragile item floor placement logic in `findBestPosition()`. The old code (lines 278-286) checked whether ANY stackable item existed ANYWHERE in `existingPlacements` — if so, it skipped floor positions (`floorHeight === 0`) for fragile items. This meant once any stackable cargo was on the trailer, fragile items could never be placed on the floor. They were either forced to stack on top of something (defeating the purpose of fragile handling) or couldn't be placed at all. The intent was "don't stack fragile items on top of other items" but the condition was inverted. Replaced the entire 8-line block (`if (item.fragile && floorHeight === 0 && existingPlacements.length > 0) { ... }`) with a single line: `if (item.fragile && floorHeight > 0) continue`. This correctly: (1) allows fragile items on the floor (`floorHeight === 0` → condition false → position not skipped), (2) prevents fragile items from stacking on other items (`floorHeight > 0` → condition true → position skipped), (3) prevents fragile-on-fragile stacking (both fragile items must go on floor since `floorHeight > 0` is always blocked). The `buildStackingMap()` function already handles the reverse case (preventing items from being placed ON TOP of fragile items) through the `canStack` flag: items without explicit `stackable: true` set `canStack = false` in their grid cells, which blocks stacking attempts during the grid scan loop (lines 261-264). The scoring section at lines 297-301 has a now-dead `else if (item.fragile)` branch that gave fragile items a bonus for higher positions (`floorHeight * 15`) — with fragile items now floor-only, this never executes. Left as-is (harmless no-op). | `stacking-engine.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Impact: fragile items that were previously unplaceable (when other cargo existed on trailer) will now be correctly placed on the floor. The sort order in `sortItemsForStacking()` already places fragile items last (lines 58-60), so they're placed after all other cargo — floor positions between existing items are available. For a trailer with 3 non-fragile items and 1 fragile item: old behavior would skip all floor positions for the fragile item (because stackable items exist), leaving it unplaced or forced onto a stack. New behavior places it on the floor in the best available gap. |
| 19 | 2026-01-28 | P3-04 | Unified truck scoring through `selectTrucks()`. Previously, `findBestTruckForItem()` had a simplified inline scoring algorithm: flat permit penalty (`permits.length * 15`), flat +20 legal bonus, simple drive-on equipment match (+15 for 5 keyword patterns), no truck availability tiers, no proportional height/width/weight penalties, no weight capacity overkill check, no seasonal restrictions. `findBestTruckForLoad()` created a virtual item with description "Load" and called `findBestTruckForItem()`, losing all equipment matching context. Now both functions create a `ParsedLoad` and delegate to `selectTrucks()` from `truck-selector.ts`. This provides: proportional height penalty (up to 40 pts based on excess feet), proportional width penalty (up to 25 pts), proportional weight penalty (up to 30 pts based on excess %), height overkill penalty (10 pts if >3 ft clearance), weight capacity overkill (up to 20 pts if truck has 3x+ capacity), truck availability tiers (+10 Tier 1 common, 0 Tier 2, -15 Tier 3 specialty, -30 Tier 4 superload), cost-weighted permit penalty (up to 30 pts, scaled by actual permit costs — $500 superload penalized more than $75 basic), enhanced equipment matching via 12 cargo profiles (excavator, dozer, loader, crane, forklift, tractor, skidsteer, transformer, windTurbine, boat, modularBuilding, tank) with preferred/avoided truck categories and loading method checks, historical data bonus (up to 15 pts), seasonal restriction penalty (10-25 pts), and escort proximity warnings. `findBestTruckForLoad()` now passes actual `load.items` to the `ParsedLoad` instead of a virtual item with description "Load", enabling proper equipment matching from real item descriptions. Tier 4 superload trucks (SPMT, Schnabel, etc.) are now filtered out for non-superload cargo (weight ≤ 100k lbs) — previously all 62 trucks were scored. Both functions maintain the same return type signature; callers are unchanged. Permits are now sourced from `PermitRequired.reason` field (e.g. "Total height of 14.2' exceeds 13.5' legal limit") instead of inline formatting (e.g. "Oversize Height (14.2' > 13.5')") — slightly different wording but same information. | `load-planner.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Scoring changes: (1) An excavator previously scored +15 for drive-on equipment match; now scores up to +25 (preferred category bonus + loading method match via equipment profiles). (2) A legal truck previously got a flat +20 bonus; now gets 0 permit penalty instead (equivalent effect via absence of penalty rather than bonus). (3) Tier 1 common trucks (flatbed, step deck, dry van) now get +10 availability bonus — previously no tier consideration. (4) Tier 3 specialty trucks (reefer, stretch RGN) now get -15 penalty. (5) A truck with 3× capacity overkill now gets up to -20 weight overkill penalty — previously only height overkill was checked. Net effect: truck recommendations will shift toward common, well-matched trucks and away from specialty/oversized equipment for normal cargo. Strategy planners retain their own specialized scoring within their strategy logic. |
| 18 | 2026-01-28 | P3-03 | Changed fallback utilization cap from 100% to 95% in `planLoads()`. The assignment loop has two passes: primary at 85% target utilization, and a fallback for items that don't fit at 85%. The fallback previously used `MAX_UTILIZATION = 100`, meaning items could fill trucks to absolute capacity. This left zero room for the subsequent `rebalanceLoads()` pass — the rebalancer moves items from >90% trucks to <80% trucks, but a 100%-full truck can't accept incoming items. Renamed `MAX_UTILIZATION` to `FALLBACK_UTILIZATION` and changed value from 100 to 95. The hard physical capacity limit (>100%) is still enforced by `canAddItemToLoad()` at line 477 (`newTotalWeight > truck.maxCargoWeight`), independent of the soft target parameter. With the 95% cap, fallback-assigned trucks land at 85-95% utilization — above the rebalancer's 90% source threshold, so they become natural candidates for having items moved OFF them. Items that don't fit any existing load at 95% now fall through to creating a new dedicated truck (existing code path at line 831), preferring a slightly higher truck count over force-packed loads that can't be optimized. Subtask 3.2 (flag fallback-assigned items with `_assignedViaFallback`) was deemed unnecessary — with the 95% cap, the rebalancer's existing heuristics (>90% source, <80% destination) naturally target fallback trucks without explicit flagging. | `load-planner.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Impact: loads that previously hit 96-100% utilization via fallback will now either (a) cap at 95% with room for rebalancing, or (b) create a new truck if 95% isn't achievable. For most cargo mixes, this produces the same truck count — the 85-95% range is narrow and only matters when an item pushes an existing truck from ~85% to ~96-100%. In that case, the item now gets its own truck, and rebalancing can optimize both trucks afterward. Worst case: one additional truck for a borderline load. Best case: better-balanced multi-truck plans because the rebalancer has room to work. |
| 17 | 2026-01-28 | P3-02 | Added physical fit validation to rebalancing move-item pass. Previously, `rebalanceLoads()` in `load-planner.ts` filtered candidate items for inter-truck moves using only `canAddItemToLoad()`, which checks weight capacity and target utilization (95%) but NOT whether the item physically fits in the remaining deck space. A truck with 30% weight capacity remaining but only small gaps between existing cargo would accept a large item — the move would succeed, placements would be recalculated, and the item would get a `failed: true` placement (no valid position). Added `canFitOnTruck()` call to the movable-items filter at line 627. This function performs: (1) weight check against `maxCargoWeight`, (2) area check with 75% packing efficiency factor, (3) full 2D `calculatePlacements()` run verifying no `failed` placements. Items that pass `canAddItemToLoad()` but fail `canFitOnTruck()` are now skipped — the rebalancer moves to the next candidate or next truck pair. The merge pass (lines 662-706) already had proper placement verification via `calculatePlacements()` + `placements.some(p => p.failed)` check — no change needed there. Subtask 2.2 (recalculate placements after move) was already implemented at lines 651-652. | `load-planner.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. The fix adds one `canFitOnTruck()` call per candidate item per rebalance attempt. `canFitOnTruck()` runs `calculatePlacements()` internally, which uses 0.5-ft grid scanning — this is O(items × grid_positions) per call. For typical loads (<10 items), this is negligible. For larger loads, the early-exit checks (weight, area) in `canFitOnTruck()` prevent unnecessary placement runs. The rebalance loop is already bounded: it only considers items on trucks >90% utilization moving to trucks <80% utilization, and moves at most 1 item per pair. Worst case for a 5-truck plan: ~20 filter evaluations, each running placement for ~5-10 items — well under 1ms total. |
| 16 | 2026-01-28 | P3-01 | Added defensive quantity multiplication to area and weight checks in `canFitOnTruck()` and `rebalanceLoads()` merge pass. Traced all 5 call paths to `canFitOnTruck()`: `planLoads()` (×2 — target utilization pass and hard limit pass), `tryAddToExistingLoads()` (called from `generateFastestPlan`, `generateMaxSafetyPlan`, `generateBestPlacementPlan`). All callers use items expanded via `expandItems()` (quantity=1), so the bug was latent — no active miscount in production. Applied 3 defensive fixes: (1) `canFitOnTruck()` weight check changed from `existingItems.reduce((s, i) => s + i.weight, 0) + newItem.weight` to `existingItems.reduce((s, i) => s + getItemWeight(i), 0) + getItemWeight(newItem)` — `getItemWeight()` multiplies by `(item.quantity \|\| 1)`. (2) `canFitOnTruck()` area check changed from `i.length * i.width` to `i.length * i.width * (i.quantity \|\| 1)` for both existing items and new item. (3) `rebalanceLoads()` merge-pass area check changed from `i.length * i.width` to `i.length * i.width * (i.quantity \|\| 1)`. Verified packing efficiency factor is consistent at 75% (`PACKING_EFFICIENCY = 0.75` in `canFitOnTruck()`, `0.75` literal in merge pass). No changes to `types.ts` — all fixes are in `load-planner.ts` only. | `load-planner.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. All fixes are no-ops when quantity=1 (post-expansion), but protect against any future code path that calls these functions with unexpanded items. The `getItemWeight()` helper already existed and correctly handles `quantity \|\| 1` — the weight check was the only caller in `canFitOnTruck()` not using it. |
| 15 | 2026-01-28 | P2-05 | Fixed silent $0 per-mile fees when distance not provided. Both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` had `distanceInState: number = 0` default — when callers omitted distance, all per-mile and ton-mile fees calculated as $0 with no indication anything was wrong. Added `MINIMUM_DISTANCE_FALLBACK_MILES = 50` constant in `permit-calculator.ts`. Both functions now detect when `distanceInState <= 0` and the state has distance-based fees (`perMileFee` or `tonMileFee`), use the 50-mile minimum fallback for fee calculation, and generate a warning: "Distance not provided for {state} — using 50-mile minimum estimate for per-mile fees. Actual costs may be higher." Added `warnings?: string[]` optional field to both `PermitRequirement` and `DetailedPermitRequirement` interfaces in `types.ts`. For `calculateDetailedStatePermit()`, also appends a calculation detail note with the fallback indicator. Route-level functions (`calculateRoutePermits`, `calculateDetailedRoutePermits`) now propagate per-state warnings to their route-level `warnings` arrays using `permit.warnings && warnings.push(...permit.warnings)`. Caller audit found: `client-route-calculator.ts` (3 calls), `RouteIntelligence.tsx`, `RouteComparisonTab.tsx` all pass proper `stateDistances` from geocoding — unaffected. `getStatePermits` tRPC endpoint and `getStatesRequiringPermits()` don't pass distance — now get 50-mile minimum instead of $0. Test file calls without distance are unaffected (tests check permit requirements, not fees). This completes Phase 2. | `types.ts`, `permit-calculator.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Example impact for Alabama (overweight, has perMileFee $0.04): Old with no distance = $0 per-mile fees (silent). New = $0.04 × 50 mi = $2.00 per-mile minimum + warning. For a state with no distance-based fees (e.g., California base-only), behavior unchanged — no fallback triggered, no warning generated. The 50-mile fallback is conservative: real interstate routes through a state are typically 100-400+ miles. The intent is to avoid $0 (clearly wrong) while not wildly overestimating. The warning tells the user the estimate is approximate. |
| 14 | 2026-01-28 | P2-04 | Replaced flat 45 mph oversize speed with dimension-aware speed tiers. Previously, `HOS_LIMITS.OVERSIZE_AVG_SPEED: 45` was used for ALL oversize loads — a 16' wide superload got the same speed estimate as a barely-oversize 9' wide load. Real-world speeds vary from 30-45 mph depending on cargo severity (escort pacing, bridge detours, utility lifts, police escort crawl speeds). Added `OVERSIZE_SPEEDS` constant to `types.ts` with 5 tiers: `LEGAL` (55 mph), `MILD_OVERSIZE` (45 — width 8.6'-10', height 13.6'-14.5'), `MODERATE_OVERSIZE` (40 — width 10.1'-12', height 14.6'-15.5'), `HEAVY_OVERSIZE` (35 — width 12.1'-14', height 15.6'-16.5'), `SUPERLOAD` (30 — width 14'+, height 16.6'+, weight >200k lbs). Added `getOversizeSpeed(width?, height?, weight?)` to `hos-validator.ts` — classifies cargo into the worst-case tier based on any dimension and returns the appropriate speed. Changed `HOS_LIMITS.OVERSIZE_AVG_SPEED` from 45 to 35 (conservative default when dimensions unknown — matches the pre-existing escort calculator speed). Added optional `oversizeSpeedMph?: number` parameter to the full HOS function chain: `calculateDriveTime`, `calculateDriveTimeWithStops`, `findRequiredBreakLocations`, `findOvernightLocations`, `validateTripHOS`, `estimateDeliveryWindow`, `generateTripPlan`. When provided, overrides the `isOversize` boolean logic. Updated `load-planner.ts` HOS validation caller to compute worst-case cargo dimensions (`maxWidth`, `maxTotalHeight`, `maxWeight`) across all enhanced loads and pass the dimension-aware speed via `getOversizeSpeed()`. Updated `calculateEscortDays` in `cost-optimizer.ts` to accept optional `avgSpeedMph` parameter (default `ESCORT_COSTS.OVERSIZE_AVG_SPEED_MPH = 35`). Exported `getOversizeSpeed` from `index.ts`. Exported `OVERSIZE_SPEEDS` from `index.ts`. | `types.ts`, `hos-validator.ts`, `load-planner.ts`, `cost-optimizer.ts`, `index.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Example impact for a 500-mile trip: Old (45 mph) = 11.1h drive, 1 overnight. New with 15' wide load (30 mph superload) = 16.7h drive, 2 overnights — a 50% increase in estimated duration. This correctly identifies HOS violations that were previously missed: the old estimate fit in 2 driving days but the realistic estimate requires 3 days. For a mild oversize load (9' wide), the new system correctly uses 45 mph — same as the old flat rate — so legal-borderline loads are not penalized. The default fallback (no dimensions) changed from 45→35 mph, which is conservative: a 500-mile trip now estimates 14.3h instead of 11.1h. This is appropriate since callers without dimensions can't classify the load — better to overestimate than underestimate. The escort calculator already used 35 mph; HOS now matches, resolving the inconsistency noted in P5-03. |
| 13 | 2026-01-28 | P2-03 | Replaced flat overheight surcharges with realistic severity tiers. Old code in `calculatePermitCosts()` added tiny flat surcharges: $50 per state for >15' and $100 per state for >16'. Real overheight permits cost $500-$5,000+ per state at higher heights due to route surveys, bridge clearance analysis, utility coordination, and engineering reviews. New code uses 4 exclusive height tiers: Tier 1 (13.6'-14.5') base fee only ($75/state via `PERMIT_BASE_COSTS_CENTS.HEIGHT`), Tier 2 (14.6'-15.5') +$250/state for enhanced permits and route review, Tier 3 (15.6'-16.5') +$750/state for route survey and bridge clearance analysis, Tier 4 (16.6'+) +$2,000/state for superload classification with full route survey, utility coordination, and engineering review. Added utility crossing cost estimate for loads >16': `Math.ceil(distanceMiles / 50) × $750` per crossing — represents wire lifting at overhead utility crossings, estimated at ~1 crossing per 50 miles in mixed urban/rural areas. Added `HEIGHT_PERMIT_TIERS_CENTS` constant object to `types.ts` with 5 fields: `TIER_2_SURCHARGE` (25,000¢), `TIER_3_SURCHARGE` (75,000¢), `TIER_4_SURCHARGE` (200,000¢), `UTILITY_CROSSING_INTERVAL_MILES` (50), `UTILITY_CROSSING_COST_CENTS` (75,000¢). Imported `HEIGHT_PERMIT_TIERS_CENTS` in `cost-optimizer.ts`. | `types.ts`, `cost-optimizer.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Example impact for a 17' tall load across 3 states over 500 miles: Old = $75×3 + $50×3 + $100×3 = $675 ($225/state). New = $75×3 + $2,000×3 + $750×10 crossings = $13,725. This 20× increase reflects real-world costs — a 17' load truly does require $2,000-5,000 per state in permits plus $500-1,500 per utility crossing. For a 15' load (Tier 2) across 3 states: Old = $75×3 + $50×3 = $375. New = $75×3 + $250×3 = $975. More realistic but not extreme. The permit-calculator's per-state data (in `state-permits.ts`) already handles height surcharges via `dimensionSurcharges.height` — those values are small ($15-$90) because they only cover the state's basic permit surcharge, not route survey/utility costs. The cost-optimizer tiers fill this gap as national-average estimates. |
| 12 | 2026-01-28 | P2-02 | Escort costs now scale with route distance instead of charging a flat 1-day rate. Previously, `calculatePermitCosts()` in `cost-optimizer.ts` added `PILOT_CAR_PER_DAY_CENTS` once per escort regardless of trip length — a 1,000-mile route was charged the same $800/escort as a 100-mile route. Added `calculateEscortDays(distanceMiles)` helper: computes `Math.ceil(distanceMiles / 350)` where 350 = 35 mph avg × 10 driving hrs/day (daylight-only oversize travel), minimum 1 day. Added `distanceMiles` as a new optional parameter (default 0) to `calculatePermitCosts()`. All escort daily rates (pilot car, second escort, police escort) now multiply by `escortDays`. Added one-time mobilization/demobilization fee per escort vehicle ($350 via `ESCORT_COSTS.MOBILIZATION_PER_VEHICLE_CENTS`). Updated `calculateTruckCost()` to pass its `distanceMiles` through to `calculatePermitCosts()`. Added three new constants to `ESCORT_COSTS` in `types.ts`: `MOBILIZATION_PER_VEHICLE_CENTS` (35,000), `OVERSIZE_AVG_SPEED_MPH` (35), `OVERSIZE_DRIVING_HOURS_PER_DAY` (10). Exported `calculateEscortDays` from `index.ts`. | `cost-optimizer.ts`, `types.ts`, `index.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Example impact for a 13' wide load (1 escort) over 700 miles: Old = $800 (1 day flat). New = $800 × 2 days + $350 mob/demob = $1,950. For a 15' wide load (2 escorts) over 1,000 miles: Old = $1,600 (2×$800 flat). New = 2 × $800 × 3 days + 2 × $350 = $5,500. The `calculateTruckCost()` function defaults `distanceMiles` to 500 — so even without explicit distance, escorts now cost 2 days ($800×2 + $350 = $1,950 for 1 escort) vs the old flat $800. |
| 11 | 2026-01-28 | P2-01 | Fixed weight bracket fee calculation from `Math.max()` to additive. Both `calculateStatePermit()` and `calculateDetailedStatePermit()` had the same bug: weight bracket fees competed with per-mile/ton-mile fees via `Math.max(estimatedFee, baseFee + bracket.fee)` instead of being added cumulatively. Changed bracket fee application from `Math.max` to `estimatedFee += bracket.fee` in both functions — bracket fees now always stack on top of base + distance-based fees. Also refactored per-mile/ton-mile fee sections in both functions to enforce mutual exclusivity: if a state defines both `perMileFee` and `tonMileFee` (currently none do, but as a safety guard), only the larger is applied. In `calculateDetailedStatePermit()`, this includes a calculation detail note documenting the conflict. Research found: 41 states use per-mile, 2 use ton-mile (AR, TN), 6 have weight brackets (AL, AZ, CO, FL, IN, TX), 3 base-only (AK, HI, CA). Only 2 states (Alabama, Indiana) have BOTH per-mile and brackets — these are the states directly affected by the fix. | `permit-calculator.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Example impact for Alabama (baseFee $50, perMileFee $0.04, bracket fee $40 for 110k lbs, 200 miles): Old = Math.max(50+8, 50+40) = $90 (lost $8 per-mile fee). New = 50+8+40 = $98 (both fees applied correctly). For states with only one fee type, behavior is unchanged. |
| 10 | 2026-01-28 | P1-09 | Fixed `maxLegalCargoHeight` for Dry Van 53' and Dry Van 48'. Both had `maxLegalCargoHeight: 9.0` but with `deckHeight: 4.0` the correct value per the formula `13.5 - deckHeight` is 9.5. The 9.0 value was likely based on typical dry van interior ceiling height (~108-110"), but the field represents the legal height limit based on federal 13.5 ft overall height, not the physical interior. Updated both to 9.5 with comments noting interior ceiling may be lower. Also ran full verification of all 62 truck definitions against the formula — only these 2 dry vans were incorrect. Reefer trucks (53'/48') intentionally use 8.5 (less than formula) because refrigeration units reduce interior clearance. The original audit only flagged Dry Van 53'; Dry Van 48' was a bonus find during systematic verification. | `trucks.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Impact: cargo between 9.0-9.5 ft tall will now correctly show Dry Van 53'/48' as options instead of being rejected. The 0.5 ft difference (6 inches) matters for palletized freight stacked to common heights. |
| 9 | 2026-01-28 | P1-08 | Fixed grid boundary overflow in stacking engine. `buildStackingMap()` and `findBestPosition()` used `Math.ceil()` for end grid cell indices (`endX`, `endZ`, `endGx`, `endGz`), which could produce an index exceeding array bounds when an item edge aligned exactly with a grid boundary. Example: item at x=0, length=48 on 48' deck → `Math.ceil(48.0 / 0.5) = 96`, but grid has indices 0-95. For non-exact boundaries, `Math.ceil` also marked one extra cell beyond the item footprint. Changed all four end-index calculations from `Math.ceil` to `Math.floor`. Added `Math.max(0, ...)` clamping on start indices (`startX`, `startZ`) to guard against negative coordinates (e.g. failed placements with sentinel -1 values from P1-03). Added `if (placement.failed) continue` in `buildStackingMap()` to skip failed placements entirely — these have no valid deck position and their sentinel coordinates would produce invalid grid indices. Added early-continue safety check (`if (startX > endX \|\| startZ > endZ) continue`) after clamping to skip degenerate ranges. | `stacking-engine.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged (all in unrelated test files). The `Math.floor` change is conservative: for exact grid-boundary alignments (e.g. item ending at exactly 3.0 ft → cell index 6 on 0.5 ft grid), `Math.floor` produces the same value as `Math.ceil` and still marks the boundary cell. For non-exact positions, `Math.floor` correctly stops at the last cell the item actually occupies, whereas `Math.ceil` would include one cell beyond. The `Math.min(gridLength - 1, ...)` clamp remains as an additional safety net. |
| 8 | 2026-01-28 | P1-07 | Enforced DOT 70-hour/8-day cumulative cycle limit in HOS validator. Previously, `validateTripHOS()` only compared drive time to `cycleRemaining`, ignoring non-driving on-duty hours (pre-trip inspection, fueling, paperwork) that also count toward the 70-hour limit per 49 CFR 395.3. A driver with 10 hours remaining on their cycle could be approved for a 15-hour on-duty trip. Added `cycleHoursUsed`, `cycleDaysRemaining`, `lastResetDate` to `HOSStatus` interface. Added `estimatedOnDutyTime`, `cycleViolation`, `restartRequired`, `restartDelayHours` to `TripHOSValidation`. Created `calculateTotalOnDutyTime()` — computes drive time + non-driving on-duty (45 min/day standard, +30 min/day oversize for escort coordination). Created `resetAfter34HourRestart()` — returns a fresh `HOSStatus` after a 34-hour restart per 49 CFR 395.3(d). Updated `validateTripHOS()` to use total on-duty hours (not just drive time) for cycle check, detect single-cycle vs multi-cycle violations, suggest 34-hour restart with delay calculation, and warn when cycle margin is <20%. Updated `updateHOSAfterDriving()` to track `cycleHoursUsed`. Updated `estimateDeliveryWindow()` to add restart delay to delivery timeline. Updated `generateTripPlan()` to include 34-hour restart events in schedule with DOT reference notes. Updated `getSmartLoadPlanSummary()` in `load-planner.ts` to display on-duty time, cycle violation, and restart info. Exported `resetAfter34HourRestart`, `calculateTotalOnDutyTime`, `updateHOSAfterDriving`, `resetAfterBreak` from `index.ts`. Added `HOS_LIMITS.CYCLE_DAYS_8`, `CYCLE_DAYS_7`, `RESTART_HOURS` (34), `NON_DRIVING_ON_DUTY_PER_DAY` (45 min) constants. | `types.ts`, `hos-validator.ts`, `load-planner.ts`, `index.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged (all in unrelated test files). Example impact: a driver with 8h cycle remaining assigned a 600-mile oversize trip (≈13.3h drive + ≈1.25h non-driving = 14.6h on-duty) would now correctly flag a cycle violation and suggest a 34-hour restart adding 34h to the delivery timeline. Previously this was silently approved because only 13.3h drive time was checked against 8h remaining, and the check only compared drive hours — now it compares total on-duty hours. |
| 7 | 2026-01-28 | P1-06 | Implemented angle-adjusted effective WLL for tie-down compliance per DOT 49 CFR 393.106. Previously, all compliance checks summed raw rated WLL values, ignoring the tie-down angle — a tie-down at 45° was treated as having full restraint capacity when it actually only provides cos(45°) ≈ 70.7% of its rated WLL. Added `calculateEffectiveWLL(wll, angle)` helper function (`wll × cos(angle)`). Added `effectiveWLL` field (required) to `TieDownPoint` interface — computed and set on every tie-down point creation in `generateTieDownPositions()`. Changed `generateSecurementPlan()` to sum `effectiveWLL` for compliance checking instead of raw `wll`. Added `totalRatedWLL` field to `SecurementPlan` for transparency (UI can show both). Compliance notes added when angle reduces effectiveness by >15%. Updated `validateSecurement()` to report both rated and effective WLL in deficit messages. Updated steep angle warnings (>60°) to show actual effectiveness percentage. Updated `generateLoadSecurementPlan()` summary to display both effective and rated WLL. Exported `calculateEffectiveWLL` from `index.ts`. | `types.ts`, `securement-planner.ts`, `index.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Example impact: 4 straps at 45° with 5,400 lb WLL each — old total: 21,600 lbs, new effective total: 15,274 lbs. For a 25,000 lb item (required WLL: 12,500 lbs), this still passes, but for heavier loads the angle adjustment can correctly flag non-compliance that was previously missed. |
| 6 | 2026-01-28 | P1-05 | Fixed tridem+ axle limit formula. Changed per-axle weight increment beyond tridem from 8,000 lbs to 5,500 lbs. The old 8,000 value was too permissive — likely confused with the single-to-tandem increment (20k→34k = 7k/axle). The correct conservative value for typical 4-5 ft axle spacing is ~5,500 lbs per additional axle per federal Bridge Formula B (23 CFR 658.17). Added named constant `AXLE_LIMITS.PER_ADDITIONAL_AXLE = 5500` to replace the magic number. Impact: multi-axle trailers (4+ axles) now have lower trailer axle limits — e.g. quad axle: 47,500 lbs (was 50,000), 5-axle: 53,000 lbs (was 58,000). This prevents overweight configurations from passing validation. | `types.ts`, `weight-distribution.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. Full Bridge Formula B implementation (spacing-dependent limits) is tracked separately as P5-01. |
| 5 | 2026-01-28 | P1-04 | Replaced broken single-beam axle weight model with proper 2-beam pin-jointed static model. Old model: computed trailer axle via moments (with inconsistent reference points — cargo moments about kingpin but trailer moment about drive axle), then subtracted a fixed 33% steer ratio from the residual, which could go negative. New model: Beam 1 (trailer) — moments about kingpin solve trailer axle weight, then kingpin reaction = trailer load - trailer axle weight. Beam 2 (tractor) — kingpin reaction transferred to tractor, moments about steer axle solve drive axle weight, steer = tractor weight + kingpin reaction - drive. Conservation law (steer + drive + trailer = GVW) always holds. Added `steerAxlePosition` field to `AxleConfiguration` interface (required). Updated all 18 entries in `DEFAULT_AXLE_CONFIGS` with steer positions (standard: -17 ft, heavy haul: -20 ft, specialized: -18 ft). Added `TRACTOR_CG_RATIO = 0.6` constant. Added SPMT special case (powerUnitWeight=0 → all weight on trailer axles). Added 6 new warning checks in `scoreWeightDistribution()`: negative axle weight (3 checks, -40 score each), low steer axle <10k lbs (-20 score), any axle <5% of GVW (3 checks, -10 score each). Removed old `Math.max(0, ...)` clamping that broke conservation. | `types.ts`, `weight-distribution.ts` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors unchanged. The old model also had an inconsistent moment reference point bug (cargo moment about kingpin, trailer moment about drive axle) — this is now fixed by the clean 2-beam decomposition. The `steerAxlePosition` field is now required on `AxleConfiguration` — no external code constructs this interface (only `DEFAULT_AXLE_CONFIGS` and function parameters that pass through from it). |
| 4 | 2026-01-28 | P1-03 | Replaced silent (0,0) fallback placement with explicit `failed: true` marking. Added `failed?: boolean` to `ItemPlacement` and `ItemPlacement3D` interfaces. Fixed `canFitOnTruck()` — was broken because fallback always produced a placement, so count check always passed; now also checks `!placements.some(p => p.failed)`. Fixed `rebalanceLoads()` merge verification with same pattern. Added per-load warnings when placements fail ("manual arrangement required"). Updated `TrailerDiagram.tsx` with red hatched pattern, "NOT PLACED" label, and dashed stroke for failed items in both top and side views. Updated `LoadPlanVisualizer.tsx` item list with red "Not placed" badge. `failed` flag propagates automatically to 3D placements via spread operator. | `types.ts`, `load-planner.ts`, `TrailerDiagram.tsx`, `LoadPlanVisualizer.tsx` | TypeScript compiles clean. Pre-existing test errors in unrelated files (permissions.test.ts, errors.test.ts) unchanged. The secondary fix to `canFitOnTruck()` is arguably the more impactful change — it was a broken verification that allowed items to be "placed" even when they didn't physically fit. |
| 3 | 2026-01-27 | P1-02 | Added `powerUnitWeight` field to `TruckType` interface and all 62 truck definitions (hotshot=9000, SPMT=0, heavy haul=20000, standard=17000). Replaced all `LEGAL_LIMITS.TRACTOR_WEIGHT` references in GVW calculations with `truck.powerUnitWeight`. Updated `truck-type-converter.ts` to derive power unit weight from category/name for DB-backed trucks. Fixed `QuotePDFTemplate.tsx` inline truck objects. | `types.ts`, `trucks.ts`, `load-planner.ts`, `truck-selector.ts`, `weight-distribution.ts`, `cost-optimizer.ts`, `escort-calculator.ts`, `route-validator.ts`, `truck-type-converter.ts`, `QuotePDFTemplate.tsx` | TypeScript compiles clean. `LEGAL_LIMITS.TRACTOR_WEIGHT` kept as fallback default. |
| 2 | 2026-01-27 | P1-01 | Standardized all monetary values to cents. Created shared `ESCORT_COSTS` and `PERMIT_BASE_COSTS_CENTS` constants in types.ts. Converted `escort-calculator.ts`, `cost-optimizer.ts`, `permit-calculator.ts` from dollars to cents. Updated `DEFAULT_COST_DATA.dailyCost` → `dailyCostCents`. Updated `PlanningOptions.fuelPrice` to cents. Fixed all display formatting in `load-planner.ts` and `PlanComparisonPanel.tsx` to divide by 100. | `types.ts`, `escort-calculator.ts`, `cost-optimizer.ts`, `permit-calculator.ts`, `load-planner.ts`, `PlanComparisonPanel.tsx` | TypeScript compiles clean. State permit data still in dollars internally — converted at boundary in permit-calculator. |
| 1 | 2026-01-27 | -- | Initial audit completed. 45 issues documented across 5 phases. Created progress tracker and 5 phase detail files. | `docs/Load Planner upgrade/*` (new files) | No code changes. Audit only. |

## Decisions & Notes

> Record any decisions made during implementation that future sessions should know about.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-27 | Fix P1-01 (unit mismatch) before all other issues | Any cost-related fix built on top of mismatched units would itself be wrong. This is the foundation. |
| 2026-01-27 | Phase order: Safety → Cost → Algorithm → Data → Advanced | Safety/DOT issues carry legal risk. Cost issues affect revenue. Algorithm issues affect UX. Data issues are incremental improvements. |
| 2026-01-27 | Standardize all monetary values to cents (integers) | Matches database schema, avoids floating-point rounding, consistent with existing quote system. |
| 2026-01-28 | Use 2-beam pin-jointed model (not fixed steer ratio) for axle weights | A fixed 33% steer ratio ignores load position entirely, making steer weight constant regardless of cargo placement. The 2-beam model correctly computes all 3 axle groups from physics, conserves total weight, and naturally produces negative values for impossible configurations (which are then flagged as warnings). |
